  // `localBaseUrlNative`) — see the `kIsWeb` branch in [baseUrl]. This isn't
  // optional: the backend sets SameSite=Lax cookies (apps/accounts/views.py),
  // and a browser refuses to attach a SameSite=Lax cookie to a cross-site XHR/
  // fetch request. Chrome serves the app from `http://localhost:<port>`, so
  // anything other than `localhost` here (an IP, `127.0.0.1`, a LAN address)
  // is cross-site from the browser's point of view — login itself still
  // succeeds (it doesn't need to read a cookie), but the very next
  // authenticated call goes out with the cookie silently dropped, producing
  // "Authentication credentials were not provided" — i.e. an immediate,
  // confusing forced logout right after a successful login.
  //   - `flutter run -d chrome`: `http://localhost:8000/api` (never edit this
  //     one — see above).
  //   - iOS Simulator (native, but same Mac): also needs `localhost`, so set
  //     `localBaseUrlNative` to `http://localhost:8000/api` while using it.
  //   - Android emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api` — 10.0.2.2 is the
  //     emulator's alias for the host machine's localhost.
  //   - A physical phone over Wi-Fi: the dev machine's LAN IP (same Wi-Fi
  //     network as the phone), e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:8000/api` — the phone
  //     has no way to resolve "localhost" as this machine.
  // `localBaseUrlNative` is the one you swap between the last three based on
  // which native target you're currently running. Currently set for
  // physical-device-over-Wi-Fi testing (this Mac's LAN IP as of 2026-08-25 —
  // re-check with `ipconfig getifaddr en0` if it's stale, e.g. after
  // reconnecting to Wi-Fi).
